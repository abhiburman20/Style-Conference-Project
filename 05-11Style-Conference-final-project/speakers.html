            <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>

            <p>Workplace culture doesn&#8217;t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, 
              and it doesn&#8217;t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It&#8217;s the unwritten rules,
               behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it&#8217;s what stifles
               a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a
               culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>

            <p>In Prashant&#8217;s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that 
              *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies 
              have that others don&#8217;t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own 
              workplace&#8217;s culture. Once you&#8217;ve worked within a culture of design it&#8217;s
               almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>

            <h5>About Prashant</h5>

            <h5>(You Should Be) Testing Your JavaScript</h5>

            <p>JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries like jQuery, 
              AngularJS, Backbone.js and more, but how can we be sure that our code is ready for
               production? This talk will share tips on how writing tests can be written easily and
                quickly and how to remove buggy code through testing.</p>

            <h5>About Suraj</h5>

            <p>Suraj Kumar is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, 
              communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow,
